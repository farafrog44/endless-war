Being a huge, highly flammable balloon filled with hydrogen, it is the safest way to travel in the city only because it's out of the price range of most juveniles' budget. It's used by the rich elite to travel from their summer homes in Assault Flats Beach to their winter homes in Dreadford, and vice versa, without having to step foot in the more unsavory parts of the city. It does it's job well and only occasionally bursts into flames."
str_blimp_tower_description = "This mooring mast is mostly used for amassing millionaire mooks into the marvelous Neo Milwaukee multi-story zeppelin, m'lady. Basically, you can board a blimp here. All you have to do is walk up an extremely narrow spiral staircase without an adequate handrail for about 40 feet straight up and then you can embark onto the highest airship this side of the River of Slime! It'll be great! Don't mind the spontaneously combusting zeppelins crashing into the earth in the distance. That's normal."
str_downtown_station_description = "This large, imposing structure is the central hub for the entire city's rapid transit system. A public transportation powerhouse, it contains connections to every subway line in the city, and for dirt cheap. Inside of it's main terminal, a humongous split-flap display is constantly updating with the times of subway arrivals and departures. Hordes of commuters from all across the city sprint to their connecting trains, or simply spill out into the Downtown streets, ready to have their guts do the same.\n\nExits into Downtown NLACakaNM."
str_black_subway_description = "Black Line trains are strictly uniform, with dull, minimalistic furnishings producing a borderline depressing experience. Almost completely grey aside from it's style guide mandated black accents, everything is purely practical. It provides just enough for its commuting salarymen to get to work in the morning and home at night."
str_black_subway_station_description = "This sparsely decorated terminal replicates the feeling of riding on a Black Line train, otherwise known as inducing suicidal thoughts. Dim lighting barely illuminates the moldy, stained terminal walls. Inbound and outbound trains arrive and departure one after another with unreal temporal precision. You're not sure if you've ever seen a Black Line train be late. Still doesn't make you like being on one though."
str_green_subway_description = "Easily the oldest subway line in the city, with the interior design and general cleanliness to prove it.

str_green_subway_station_description = "Much like its trains, Green Line terminals have fallen into disrepair. It's vintage aesthetic only exasperating it's crumbling infrastructure, making the whole line seem like a old, dilapidated mess. But, you'll give it one thing, it's pretty cool looking from the perspective of urban exploration. You've dreamed of exploring it's vast, abandoned subway networks ever since you first rode on it. They could lead to anywhere. So close, and yet so mysterious."
str_purple_subway_description = "Probably the nicest subway line in the city, the Purple Line isn't defined by its poor hygiene or mechanical condition.

Wow!"

With limited amounts of graffiti sprayed unto the otherwise sort-of white walls, there's actually some semblance of visual simplicity. For once in this city, your eyes aren't being completely assaulted with information or blinding lights. Boring, this place sucks. Board whatever train you're getting on and get back to killing people as soon as possible."
str_pink_subway_description = "If there's one word to describe the Pink Line, it's \"confusing\". It's by far the filthiest subway line in the city, which is exponentially worsened by it's bizarre, unexplainable faux wood paneling that lines every train. You can only imagine that this design decision was made to make the subway feel less sterile and more homely, but the constant stench of piss and homeless people puking sort of ruins that idea. Riding the Pink Line makes you feel like you're at your grandma's house every single time you ride it, if your grandma's house was in Jaywalker Plain."
str_pink_subway_station_description = "It's absolutely fucking disgusting. By far the worst subway line, the Pink Line can't keep it's terrible interior design choices contained to its actual trains. Even in its terminals, the faux wood paneling clashes with every other aesthetic element present. It's ghastly ceilings have turned a delightful piss-soaked shade of faded white. It's bizarre mixture of homely decorations and completely dilapidated state makes you oddly beguiled in a way. How did they fuck up the Pink Line so bad? The world may never know."
str_gold_subway_description = "Construction started on the Gold Line in the 90’s, and it shows. It’s just so fucking gaudy. Opulent, even. It’s vaporwave gone wrong.

Imagine your loaded in the level geometry of the station into Unity and then Googled “terrible street art murals” and skipped to page nine and then loaded each image as textures unto the geometry, not even accounting for when one object ended and another surface began. No one knows why it’s like this."

Today we have a fucking ridiculous upturn for KFC, which actually got one of its supply trucks through the gang infested streets without being ransacked. Taco Bell set up a new restaraunt in New New Yonkers, but the windows aren't even bulletproof, so it's probably just gonna be a money pit for them. But my little chiclets, DO NOT invest in FUCKING PIZZA HUT. ENDLESS WAR shot a fucking laser through their kitchen and they're still in reconstruction. \n\nAs always, this is Mad Murderous Money, telling you to buy sell, die, and shill!",

Today, we'll be painting on the graffiti soaked walls of urban Green Light District. Now, the first thing you do on these urban type pieces is to sign your name here in the bottom right. This is so you will receive credit even if you have to run from the police halfway through. OK, very good. Today we're going to be doing a still life of Wreckington. We'll be doing a lot of greys here, but let's start with something fun, the flames of the burning wreckage. Wait. I forgot to bring red paint. OK, in that case, I'll have more once I fetch a Juvie during the commercial break. Stay tuned!",

This week, I read a book called 'The Gamer and The Bear'. We'll read an excerpt here. \nOnce upon a time in a cute little village at the bottom of a valley was a big rowdy bear.The bear was a real nasty guy, always smashing shit up and stomping his big feet. All the innocent little gamers of the village were scared of the big bear for if he saw them !dabbing he’d rip them limb from limb! They had to hide in their homes when he came around, !dabbing under their breath and gaming with the TV muted. It was a horrible time for everyone. \nThat was the first page, be sure to buy the full book!",
	"It's time for 'Our Deep Fuck City', where we run documentaries on the mystique of each district. Today, we'll be examining the phenomenon of 'Door Gunning', a new prank pulled by the upstarts of Little Chernobyl. In order to explain it, we must first look at a certain subculture of people there, known as half-deads. These folks live so close to the radiation of Little Chernobyl Power Plant that the radiation has more than killed them and fully decayed their minds. The problem is, they can't !revive either. They are so brain dead that ENDLESS WAR doesn't know what to do with them. So functionally, they exist as these wildly disfigured, basically immortal suburbanites. Door Gunning takes advantage of this. A prankster will knock on the door of some hapless half-dead person, and shoot them repeatedly in the face. It's incredibly painful, but since nobody dies it gets passed off as harmless fun. It really makes you think, eh?",
	"It's time for 'Our Deep Fuck City', where we run documentaries on the mystique of each district. We've got a treat for you this time, something you probably haven't heard of. Charcoal Park's efforts to fight back against hostile secreatures. You see, most districts are under Slimecorp's protection, excluding gangsters. However, Charcoal Park was such a forgettable place that they just forgot to send relief over there. Things have gotten so dire that many of the region's blue collar workers have banded together to form a militia of their own. There were many casualties at first, but intense training has turned the region into an sort of anarchist paradise. You wouldn't know it, though. To this day, their houses are kept very clean.",
	"Oh. Looks like it's playing the test screen. You know, the one with all the verticle colored stripes and the long beep. Yeah.",
	"It's time for 'Our Deep Fuck City', where we run documentaries on the mystique of each district. Most NLACakaNM citizens stay indoors for obvious reasons. Because of this, we're often oblivious to the interesting new social patterns they exhibit in this isolation. For example, Old New Yonkers has developed its own sect of Christianity. The practitioners of Neo-Protestant Milwaukeeism are convinced that ENDLESS WAR is the second coming of Christ, and that they have all been sent to Hell for their sins. Beyond that, most of the differences lie in the amount of self-flaggellation there is. NLACakaNM is a place of extremes, so what actually takes place is pretty mild compared to what else we've seen here. But despite its modesty, those folks may well be the most miserable in the city.",
	"It's time for 'Our Deep Fuck City', where we run documentaries on the mystique of each district. It's time to talk about the disappearing statue of Thalamus J. Crookline that stands in Globule Plaza. You see, Crookline's bandits have developed an inflated sense of honor among themselves. Part of that means they'll often wish themselves luck on that particular statue for good fortune in their pilfering. Every thief knows this, so it's not surprising how often the damn thing gets stolen. Hence the 'disappearance'. It costs the government like 1,000,000 slime a year just to maintain it.",

Portable game guides can also be bought there for 10,000 slime."

# Dict of all help responses linked to their associated topics
help_responses = {
	# Introductions, part 1
	"gangs":"**Gang Violence** is the center focus of **Rowdy Fuckers Cop Killers' ENDLESS WAR**. Enlisting in a gang allows you to attack other gang members, juveniles, ghosts, and slime beasts with the **'!kill'** command. To enlist in a gang, use **'!enlist'**. However, a member of that gang must use **'!vouch'** for you beforehand. Enlisting will permanently affiliate you with that gang, unless you are !pardon'd by the **ROWDY FUCKER** (Munchy), or the **COP KILLER** (Ben Saint). You may use **'!renounce'** to return to the life of a juvenile, but you will lose half of your current slime, and you will still be affiliated with that gang, thus disallowing you from entering the enemy's gang base. Additionally, a Kingpin, should they feel the need to, can inflict the '!banned' status upon you, preventing you from enlisting in their gang.",
	"food":"Food lowers your hunger by a set amount, and can be ordered from various **restaurants** within the city. Generally speaking, the more expensive food is, the more hunger it sates. You can **'!order [food name] togo'** to order it togo, otherwise you will eat it on the spot, and you can **'!use [food name]'** to use it once its in your inventory. You can only carry a certain amount of food depending on your level. Regular food items expire after 2 in-game days, or 12 hours in real life, while crops expire after 8 in-game days (48 hours), and food items gained from milling expire after a whole 2 weeks in real life. Three popular restauraunts close by various gang bases include **THE SPEAKEASY** (juveniles), **THE SMOKER'S COUGH** (rowdys), and **RED MOBSTER SEAFOOD** (killers), though there are other places to order food as well, such as the **Food Court**.",
	"capturing":"Capping is a battle for influence over the 33 districts of NLACakaNM, and one of your main goals as a gangster. Capped territories award your kingpin slime, and give your teammates benefits while visiting. Start by visiting Based Hardware and equipping one of the paint tools sold there. Once you have that, you can **!spray <captcha>** while in a capturable district's streets to gain influence for your gang. Spraying graffiti in districts will increase influence for you, or decrease it for the enemy if they have influence there. Think of dealing influence to a district like dealing damage to a Juvie's soft squishy body, with critical hits, misses, and backfires included. As you go, you can check your **!progress** to see how much influence you still need. It can be more or less depending on the territory class, running from rank C to S. \n\nA few more things to note:\n>Decapping does 0.8x the influence of capping, even though the cost remains the same.\n>Don't attack enemy territory when it is surrounded by enemy territory/outskirts. Small little bitches like yourself are prone to fucking up severely under that much pressure.\n>The nightlife starts in the late night. Fewer cops are around to erase your handiwork, so if you cap then you will gain a 33% capping bonus.\n>You can't kill for shit with paint tools equipped. Luckily, you can **!sidearm** a weapon or tool and quickly switch between your two equip slots using **switch** or **!s**.",
	"transportation":"There are various methods of transportation within the city, the quickest and most efficient of them being **The Subway System**. Trains can be boarded with **'!board'** or **'!embark'**, and to board specific trains, you can add your destination to the command. For example, to board the red line to Cratersville, you would use '!board pinktocv'. **'!disembark'** can be used to exit a train. **The Ferry** (which moves between Vagrant's Corner and Wreckington) and **The Blimp** (which moves between Dreadford and Assault Flats Beach) can also be used as methods of transportation, though they take longer to arrive at their destinations than the trains do. Refer to the diagram below on understanding which districts and streets have subway stations in them.\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/431238867459375145/570392908780404746/t_system_final_stop_telling_me_its_wrong_magicks.png",
	"death": "Death is an integral mechanic to Endless War. Even the most experienced players will face the sewers every now and again. If you find yourself in such a situation, use **'!revive'** in the sewers channel, and you will return to the land of the living as a juvenile at the base of ENDLESS WAR. Dying will drop some of your unadorned cosmetics and food, and all of your unequiped weapons, but your currently adorned cosmetics and equiped weapon will remain in your inventory (Gangsters will lose half of their food/unadorned cosmetics, while Juveniles lose only a quarter). Alternatively, you can hold off on reviving and remain a **ghost**, which has its own gameplay mechanics associated with it. To learn more, use '!help ghosts' at one of the colleges or with a game guide, or see the wiki page here: https://rfck.miraheze.org/wiki/Ghosts",
	# Introductions, part 2
	"dojo":"**The Dojo** is where you acquire weapons to fight and kill other players with. To purchase a weapon, use **'!order [weapon]'**. There are many weapons you can choose from (you can view all of them with !menu), and they all perform differently from one another. Once you've purchased a weapon, you can use **'!equip [weapon]'** to equip it, provided that you're enlisted in a gang beforehand. You can also name your weapon by spending a poudrin on it with **'!annoint [name]'**. Furthermore, annointing will increase your mastery over that weapon, but it's much more efficient to do so through **sparring**. To learn more about the sparring system and weapon ranks, use '!help sparring'.",
	"subzones":"**Subzones** are areas locations within the districts of the city where gang violence off-limits, with the only exception being the subway stations, the trains, and the base of ENDLESS WAR. If you don't type anything in a sub-zone for 60 minutes, you'll get kicked out for loitering, so be sure to check up often if you don't wanna get booted out into the streets.",
	"scouting": "Scouting is a way for you to check how many **players** might be in a district that's close by. You can do just **'!scout'** to check the district you're already in, or **'!scout [district]'** to scout out that specific district. For example, if you were in Vagrant's Corner, you could use '!scout gld' to see how many players might be in Green Light District. Scouting will show both **friendly and enemy** gang members, as well as juveniles and even enemies. Scouting will list all players/enemies above your own level, as well as players/enemies below your level, but at a certain **cutoff point**. If you can't scout someone, it's safe to assume they have around **1/10th** the amount of slime that you do, or less. It should be noted that scouting currently only gives an estimate, sending off different messages depending on how many players are in that district.",
	"wanted":"If you find that you have a role with 'Wanted' in the name, be alarmed. This means that you are able to be attacked by gangsters! Always be on the look out and remember to check your corners.",
	"combat": "Once you have enlisted in a gang, you can engage in gang violence. To do so you will need a weapon, which you can find at the Dojo and a target. To attack an enemy, you have to **!equip** a weapon and **!kill [player]**. Attacking costs slime and sap. The default cost for attacking is ((your slime level)^4 / 60), and the default damage it does to your opponent is ((your slimelevel)^4 / 6). Every weapon has an attack cost mod and a damage mod that may change these default values. When you reduce a player's slime count below 0 with your attacks, they die. Most weapons will ask you to input a security code with every attack. This security code, also referred to as a captcha, is displayed after a previous !kill or when you !inspect your weapon. Heavy weapons increase crit chance by 5% and decrease miss chance by 10% against you, when you carry them.",
	# Ways to gain slime
	"mining": "Mining is the primary way to gain slime in **ENDLESS WAR**. When you type one **'!mine'** command, you raise your hunger by a little bit. The more slime you mine for, the higher your level gets. Mining will sometimes endow you with hardened crystals of slime called **slime poudrins**, which can be used for farming and annointing your weapon. **JUVENILES** can mine any time they like, but **ROWDYS** and **KILLERS** are restricted to mining during the day (8AM-6PM) and night (8PM-6AM), respectively. If you are enlisted, you can make use of the **pickaxe**, which increases the amount of slime you gain from mining. Currently mining is event-based, with events like simple slimboosts or guaranteed poudrins for a certain time. Similarly to clicker games your base action is **!mine**, however some mines can dynamically change how mining works. Basic instructions for these variations can be found in those mines.",
	"scavenging":"Scavenging allows you to collect slime that is **stored** in districts. When someone in a district gets hurt or dies, their slime **splatters** onto the ground, allowing you to use **'!scavenge'** and collect it, similarly to mining. Scavenging raises your hunger by 1% with every command entered. If you type **!scavenge** by itself, you will be given a captca to type. The more captchas you type correctly, the more slime you will gain. To check how much slime you can scavenge, use **'!look'** while in a district channel. You can also scavenge for items by doing '!scavenge [item name]'.",
	"farming":"**Farming** is an alternative way to gain slime, accessible only by **JUVENILES**. It is done by planting poudrins on a farm with the **'!sow'** command. You can only '!sow' one poudrin per farm. After about 12 in-game hours (3 hours in real life), you can use **'!reap'** to gain 200,000 slime, with a 1/30 chance to gain a poudrin. If you do gain a poudrin, you also have 1/3 chance to gain a second poudrin. If your poudrin plant is left alone for too long (around 2 in-game days, or 12 hours in real life), it will **die out**. In addition to slime, farming also provides you with various **crops** which can be used for **milling**, but you can also **'!crush'** them to gain cosmetic materials for smelting random cosmetics. Crops can be eaten by themselves, but it's much more useful if you use **'!mill'** on them while at a farm, granting you crop materials used for smelting **dyes**, as well as food items and cosmetics associated with that crop, all at the cost of 50,000 slime per '!mill'. Dyes can be used on slimeoids with **'!saturateslimeoid'**. Crops can also be sown themselves with '!sow [crop name]', and upon reaping you be rewarded with a bushel of that crop, as well as 100,000 slime. You can, however, increase the slime gained from sowing crops by using **'!checkfarm'**, and performing **'!irrigate'**, **'!fertilize'**, **'!pesticide'** or **'!weed'** if neccessary. Current farms within the city include **JUVIE'S ROW FARMS** (within Juvie's Row), **OOZE GARDENS FARMS** (close by Rowdy Roughhouse), and **ARSONBROOK FARMS** (close by Cop Killtown).",
	"fishing": "**Fishing** can be done by performing the **'!cast'** command at one of the six piers, including **Juvie's Row Pier**, **Crookline Pier**, **Jaywalker Plain Pier**, **Toxington Pier**, **Assault Flats Beach Pier**, **Slime's End Pier**, as well as **The Ferry**. To reel in a fish, use **'!reel'** when the game tells you that you have a bite. If you don't reel in quick enough, the fish will get away. If you are enlisted and have the **fishing rod** equiped, you will have increased chances of reeling in a fish. For more information about fishing, refer to this helpful guide (credits to Miller#2705).\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHDeSukIqME>\nAs an addendum to that video, note that fish can be taken to the labs in Brawlden, where they can be made more valuble in bartering by increasing their size with **'!embiggen [fish]'**.",
	"hunting": "**Hunting** is another way to gain slime in ENDLESS WAR. To hunt, you can visit **The Outskirts**, which are layered areas located next to the edge of the map (Wreckington -> Wreckington Outskirts Edge, Wreckington Outskirts Edge -> Wreckington Outskirts, etc). In the outskirts, you will find enemies that you can !kill. Rather than doing '!kill @' like with players, with enemies you can either type their display name ('!kill Dinoslime'), their shorthand name ('!kill dino'), or their identifying letter ('!kill A'), which can be accessed with !look or !survey (WARNING: Raid bosses moving around the city do not have identifying letters. You must use the other targeting methods to attack them). To see how much slime an enemy has, you can do '!data [enemy name]', or just !data with any of the previous types of methods listed. Enemies will drop items and slime upon death, and some enemies are more powerful and threatening than others. In fact, there are enemies powerful enough to hold their own against the gangsters in the city, called **Raid Bosses**, and will enter into the city as a result, rather than just staying in the outskirts like regular enemies. **The Rowdy Roughhouse** and **Cop Killtown** will send out a response that mentions which district a raid boss has entered into. Enemies despawn after **3 hours in real life**.",
	# Additional gameplay mechanics, part 1
	"mutations": "**Mutations** are helpful bonuses you acquire when you level up. The more powerful your next mutation, the more level ups it takes to acquire. This is represented my the mutation's level. When you acquire a mutation, a short text response will indicate what it can do. To modify your mutations, you need to go to NLACakaNM Clinic of Slimoplasty in Crookline. When you get there, you can !chemo <mutation> to remove a mutation you acquired, or !chemo all to remove all possible mutations from your body. You can use !graft <mutation> to add a mutation to yourself. Keep in mind that you cannot use !chemo on a mutation if you got it through grafting, and you can only !graft a mutation if you have enough space in your mutations pool. You will likely need to !chemo a mutation out in order to !graft something else.",
	"mymutations":"You read some research notes about your current mutations...", # will print out a list of mutations with their specific mechanics
	"smelting": "Smelting is a way for you to craft certain items from certain ingredients. To smelt, you use **'!smelt [item name]'**, which will either smelt you the item, or tell which items you need to smelt the item. Popular items gained from smelting are **Cosmetics**, as well as the coveted **Pickaxe** and **Super Fishing Rod**. If you're stuck, you can look up the crafting recipes for any item with **!whatcanimake [itemname]**.",
	"sparring": "**Sparring** can be done between two players using **'!spar [player]'**. Sparring, provided that both players spar with the same weapon type and are not at full hunger, will increase both of your mastery **LEVEL**, which is a hidden value, by one. The publicly displayed value, mastery **RANK** (which is just your mastery level minus 4), is more important. It should be noted that the damage you deal with your weapon is increased even if you haven't reached rank 1 yet. However, once you do reach at least mastery rank 2 (Again, this would be level 6), when you next revive, you will now **permanently** be at level 6 for that weapon type until you annoint or spar again. Essentially, this means you will always start back at rank 2. Once you reach **rank 6**, you can no longer annoint your weapon rank any higher, and must instead kill other players/enemies (that are higher in both slime and level than you) to do so. Reaching rank 6 also stops you from increasing your own rank through sparring, unless you are sparring with someone who has a higher weapon rank than you. You can only spar up to someone else's mastery rank, minus 1 (example: Sparring with a rank 15 master of the katana would, at most, allow you to get to rank 14). Sparring has a one minute cooldown and raises your hunger by about 5%. Once you reach rank 8, you may also **'!marry'** your weapon, resulting in a matrimonial ceremony that increases your rank by two.",
	"ghosts": "Ghost gameplay revolves around the acquisition of antislime, through haunting and possession. Every use of **'!haunt'** away a small portion of slime from the haunted player, and grants it to the ghost as antislime. The amount of slime taken starts at 1/1000th and varies depending on a number of conditions, and you may also add a customized message by doing '!haunt [@player] [message]'. It can be done face-to-face like with !kill, or done remotely with decreased potency. As a ghost, you can only leave the sewers after being dead for at least a day. Furthermore, if a player has consumed **coleslaw**, they can **'!bust'** ghosts, which sends them back to the sewers. After amassing sufficient **Negative Slime** ghosts can summon **negaslimoids** in the city, with the use of **'!summon [name]'**. Negaslimeoids haunt all players within a district, and also decay capture progress. **The Rowdy Roughhouse** and **Cop Killtown** will send out a response that mentions which district a Negaslimeoid has entered into. Ghosts can also **!inhabit** living players to move alongside them. If a ghost has sufficient antislime, they may also **!possessweapon** or **!possessfishingrod** to grant bonuses to the player they're inhabiting, with a potential reward in antislime if conditions are fulfilled.

	"slimeoids":"**SLIMEOIDS** are sentient masses of slime that you can keep as **pets**. To learn how to make one for yourself, visit **The Slimeoid Laboratory** in Brawlden and check the enclosed **'!instructions'**. After you've made one, you can also battle it out with other slimeoids in **The Arena**, located in Vandal Park. Slimeoids can also be used to fight off **negaslimeoids** that have been summoned by ghosts, though be warned, as this is a fight to the death! If your slimeoid dies, it's **HEART** is dropped, which can be sown in the ground like a poudrin, or taken to the labs to revive your slimeoid with **'!restoreslimeoid'**. In regards to your slimeoid's stats, a slimeoid's **'Moxie'** represents its physical attack, **'Chutzpah'** its special attack, and **'Grit'** its defense. Additionally, the color you dye your slimeoid with **'!saturateslimeoid'** also plays into combat. Your slimeoid gets attack bonuses against slimeoids that have its split complementary hue and resist slimeoids with its analgous hues. For more information, see the diagrams linked below (credits to Connor#3355). There are also various commands you can perform on your slimeoid, such as **'!observeslimeoid'**, **'!petslimeoid'**, **'!walkslimeoid'**, and **'!playfetch'**. To humanely and ethically euthanize your slimeoid, use **'!dissolveslimeoid'** at the laboratory. To store and release your slimeoid in a bottle (Warning: This bottle is dropped upon death!!), use **'!bottleslimeoid'** and **'!unbottleslimeoid [slimeoid]'**, respectively.\n<https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/492088204053184533/586310921274523648/SLIMEOID-HUE.png>\n<https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/177891183173959680/586662087653064706/SLIMEOID-HUE.gif>\n<https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/177891183173959680/586662095848996894/SLIMEOID_HUE_NOTE.png>",
	"cosmetics":"**Cosmetics** are items that the player may wear. To equip and un-equip a cosmetic, use **'!adorn [cosmetic]'** and **'!dedorn [cosmetic]'**. If you have four slime poudrins and a cosmetic material, you can use **'!smelt'** to create a new one from scratch. These cosmetic materials can be obtained from using **'!crush'** on vegetables gained by farming. Cosmetics can either be of 'plebian' or 'patrician' quality, indicating their rarity. If you win an art contest held for the community, a Kingpin will make a **Princep** cosmetic for you, which is custom tailored, and will not leave your inventory upon death. Cosmetics can be dyed with **!dyecosmetic [cosmetic name/id] [dye name/id]**. To check which cosmetics you have adorned, you can use !fashion.",
	"realestate":"The **Real Estate Agency** is, well, the agency where you buy real estate. First, check out the property you want with **'!consult [district]'**. The real estate agent will tell you a bit about the area. \nOnce you've made your decision, you can **'!signlease [district]'** to seal the deal. There's a down payment, and you will be charged rent every 2 IRL days. Fair warning, though, if you already have an apartment and you rent a second one, you will be moved out of the first.\n\nFinally, if you own an apartment already, you can **'!aptupgrade'** it, improving its storage capabilities, but you'll be charged a huge down payment and your rent will double. The biggest upgrade stores 40 closet items, 20 food items, and 25 pieces of furniture. And if you're ready to cut and run, use **'!breaklease'** to end your contract. It'll cost another down payment, though.\n\nYou can !addkey to acquire a housekey. Giving this item to some lucky fellow gives them access to your apartment, including all your prized posessions. Getting burglarized? Use !changelocks to eliminate all housekeys you created. Both cost a premium, though.",
	"apartments":"Once you've gotten yourself an apartment, there are a variety of things you can do inside it. To enter your apartment, do **'!retire'** in the district your apartment is located in. There are certain commands related to your apartment that you must do in a direct message to ENDLESS WAR. To change the name and description of your apartment, do **'!aptname [name]'** and **'!aptdesc [description]'**, respectively. To place and remove furniture (purchasable in The Bazaar), do **'!decorate [furniture]'** and **'!undecorate [furniture]'**, respectively. You can store and remove items with **'!stow'** and **'!snag'**, respectively. To store in and remove items from the fridge, do **'!fridge [item]'** and **'!unfridge [item]'**. To store in and remove items from the closet, do **'!closet [item]'** and **'!uncloset [item]'**, respectively. To store and remove your slimeoid, do **'!freeze'** and **'!unfreeze'**, respectively. To store and remove fish, do **'!aquarium [fish]'** and **'!releasefish [fish]'**, respectively. To store and remove items such as weapons and cosmetics, do **'!propstand [item]'** and **'!unstand [item]'**, respectively. To put away zines, do **!shelve [item]** and **!unshelve [item]**. To place crops into flower pots, do **pot [item]** and **unpot [item]** To enter someone else's apartment, you can do **'!knock [player]'**, which will prompt them to let you in. This list of commands can also be accessed by using !help in a direct message to ENDLESS WAR.",
	"stocks":"**The Stock Exchange** is a sub-zone within downtown NLACakaNM, open only during the daytime (6AM-8PM). It allows players to **'!invest'** in various **'!stocks'**, which not only affects their own personal monetary gains, but the city's economy as well. Stocks will shift up and down value, which affects the price of food associated with the food chains of those respective stocks. The rate of exchange for stocks can be checked with **'!rates'**, and to withdraw your **'!shares'** from a stock, use **'!withdraw [amount] [stock]'** (the same logic also applies to !invest). Additionally, players may **'!transfer'** their slimecoin to other players at any time of the day while in the stock exchange, but at the cost of a 5% broker's fee and a 20 minute cooldown on subsequent transfers.",
	# Additional gameplay mechanics, part 3
	"trading": "Trading allows you to exchange multiple items at once with another player. You can ask someone to trade with you by using **!trade [player]**. Should they accept, you will be able to offer items with **!offer [item]**. Use **!removeoffer [item]** to remove an item from your offers. You can check both player's offers by using **!trade** again. When you're ready to finish the trade, use **!completetrade**. The items will only be exchanged when both players do the command. Note that if a player adds or removes an item afterwards you will no longer be set as ready and will need to redo the command. Should you want to cancel the trade, you can do so by using **!canceltrade**.",
	"weather": "The weather of NLACakaNM can have certain outcomes on gameplay, most notably in regards to mutations like White Nationalist or Light As A Feather. Right now, however, you should be most concerned with **Bicarbonate Rain Storms**, which rapidly destroy slime both on the ground and within your very being. It's advised that you pick up a rain coat at The Bazaar to avoid further harm. To check the weather, use **'!weather'**.",
	"casino": "**The Casino** is a sub-zone in Green Light District where players may bet their slime and slimecoin in various games, including **'!slimepachinko'**, **'!slimecraps'**, **'!slimeslots'**, **'!slimeroulette'**, **'!slimebaccarat'**, and **!slimeskat**. Some games allow you to bet certain amounts, while other games have a fixed cost. Furthermore, the casino allows you to challenge other players to a game of **'!russianroulette'**, where most of the loser's slime is transferred to the winner. To bet with slime, simply add 'slime' to the name of the game you wish to play. Example: **!slimeslots 500 slime**.",
	"bleeding": "When you get hit by someone using a '!kill' command, certain things happen to your slime. Let's say you take 20,000 points of damage. **50%** of that slime, in this case 10,000, immediately becomes scavengeable. However, the other 50%, provided that you didn't die instantly, will undergo the **bleeding** process. 25% of that slime, in this case 5,000, is immediately added to a 'bleed pool', causing it to slowly trickle out of your body and onto the ground for it to be scavenged. The remaining 25% of that slime will **slowly** be added to the 'bleed pool', where it will then bleed, just as previously stated. Upon dying, your 'bleed pool' is immediately dumped onto the ground, ready to be scavenged. Think of it like the 'rolling HP' system from the game *EarthBound*. When you get hit, you don't take all your damage upfront, it instead slowly trickles down.",
	"offline":"Given that ENDLESS WAR is a **Discord** game, there are a few peculiarities surrounding it and how it interacts with Discord itself. When you set your status to **'Offline'**, you can still move between districts if you typed a '!goto' command beforehand. You won't show up on the sidebar in that district's channel, but people can still scout for you, and see the '[player] has entered [district]' message when you do enter the district they're in. Furthermore, you **can't** use commands while offline, and can only use commands **10 seconds** after coming online again. Often times, you may find yourself using '!scout' or '!look' on a district, only to find that **no one** is there besides yourself. This is likely because they're in that district, just with their status set to offline. The exception to this, of course, is if you have the **Chameleon Skin** mutation, which lets you type a handful of commands even while offline, including **!goto**, **!look**, **!scout**, **!survey**, **!embark**, and **!disembark**.",
	# Additional gameplay mechanics, part 4
	"profile": "This isn't so much a guide on gameplay mechanics as it is just a guide for what to expect from roleplaying in ENDLESS WAR. The general rule of thumb is that your profile picture will act as your 'persona' that gets depicted in fanworks, and it can be said that many of the colorful characters you'll find in NLCakaNM originated in this way.",
	"manuscripts": "First of all, to start a manuscript, you're gonna need to head down to the Cafe, either University, or the Comic Shop.\n\nYou can **!beginmanuscript [title]** at the cost of 20k slime.\n\nIf you happen to regret your choice of title, you can just **!settitle [new title]**.\n\nThe author name is already set to your nickname, but if you want to change it, you change your nickname and then **!setpenname**.\n\nYou're required to specify a genre for your future zine by using **!setgenre [genre name]** (Genre list includes: narrative, historical, comic, ||porn||, instructional, lore, reference, journal, newspaper, and experimental).\n\nIf at any time you would like to look at the title, author name, and length of your manuscript, then use **!manuscript**.\n\n*NOW*, if you actually want to start getting stuff done, you're gonna need to **!editpage [page number] [content]**. Every zine has 10 pages (kinda) that you can work with, but you can **!setpages [pages]** to customize it (maximum is 20, minimum is 5). Each holds a maximum of 1500 characters of content. You can fill it with information, image links, smut, whatever floats your freakish boat. If you try to edit a page that already has writing, it will ask you to confirm the change before overwriting it.\n\nYou can also set a cover, which is optional. You do this with **!editpage cover [image link]**.\n\nTo check any of your pages, simply **!viewpage [number]** to see how it looks.\n\nKeep in mind that manuscripts ARE NOT items and can't be lost on death. They're accessible from any authoring location (Cafe, NLACU, NMS, Comics). A player can only have 1 manuscript out at a time.\n\nOnce you are completely finished, you can **!publish** your manuscript (it will ask you to confirm that you are completely done with it), which will enable the citizens of the town to purchase it from any zine place. From there, it will be bought and rated by the people and you may even earn some royalty poudrins for it.",
	"zines": "Zines are the hot new trend in Neo-Milwaukee and give slimebois of all shapes and sizes access to the free-market of information and culture.\n\nTo obtain a zine, you must head down to any of these locations: Green Cake Cafe, NLAC University, Neo-Milwaukee State, or Glockbury Comics.\n\nFrom there, you can **!browse** for zines. They are ordered by *Zine ID*, but you have many options for sorting them, including: **title, author, datepublished,** any of the genres (including **narrative, historical, comic, ||porn||, instructional, lore, reference, journal, newspaper,** and **experimental**.), **length, sales,** and **rating** (use **!browse [criteria]**). You can also add **reverse** on to any of these in order to make it display in reverse order. Example: **!browse bestsellers reverse** (essentially looks for worse-selling zines). Browsing in the Comic Shop will automatically browse for comic zines and browsing at the Colleges will look for historical zines (keep in mind that any zines can be bought from these places).\n\nYou can also **!browse [Zine ID]** in order to get info about that specific zine, including sales, length, genre, and rating.\n\nOnce you've found a zine that's caught your eye, simply **!orderzine [Zine ID]** to buy it for 10k slime.\n\nAfter absorbing the zine's content, it is your moral obligation as a reader to **!review [Zine Name] [Score]**. The potential scores range from between 1 and 5 *fucks* (whole numbers only). If you hate a zine, then give it one fuck. If you absolutely loved it, give it five fucks. Simple. By the way, if a zine's average rating is less than 2.0 by the time it gets to 10 ratings (or less than 1.5 by 5 ratings), it will be excluded from the default browse. The only way to purchase it will be to use the **worstrated** or **all** sorting methods.\n\nYou can **!shelve [zine name]** in your apartment after you've finished.",
	#"sap": "**Sap** is a resource your body produces to control your slime. It's integral to being able to act in combat. You can have a maximum amount of sap equal to 1.6 * ( your slime level ^ 0.75 ). When you spend it, it will regenerate at a rate of 1 sap every 5 seconds. You can spend your sap in a variety of ways: **!harden [number]** allows you to dedicate a variable amount of sap to your defense. Hardened sap reduces incoming damage by a factor of 10 / (10 + hardened sap). Your hardened sap counts against your maximum sap pool, so the more you dedicate to defense, the less you will have to attack. You can **!liquefy [number]** hardened sap back into your sap pool. Every attack requires at least 1 sap to complete. Different weapons have different sap costs. Some weapons have the ability to destroy an amount of hardened sap from your target, or ignore a portion of their hardened sap armor. This is referred to as **sap crushing** and **sap piercing** respectively. There are also other actions you can take in combat, that cost sap, such as: **!aim [player]** will slightly increase your hit chance and crit chance against that player for 10 seconds. It costs 2 sap. **!dodge [player]** will decrease that players hit chance against you for 10 seconds. It costs 3 sap. **!taunt [player]** will decrease that player's hit chance against targets other than you for 10 seconds. It costs 5 sap.",
	"sprays":"**Sprays** are your signature piece of graffiti as a gangster. You can **!changespray <image link>** in order to set your own custom image. This image appears when you get a critical hit while capping, and you can also **!tag** to spray it anywhere.",
	# Misc.
	"slimeball": "Slimeball is a sport where two teams of players compete to get the ball into the opposing team's goal to score points. A game of Slimeball is started when a player does !slimeball [team] in a district. Other players can join in by doing the same command in the same district. Once you've joined a game, you can do !slimeball to see your data, the ball's location and the score. To move around the field, use !slimeballgo [coordinates]. You can kick the ball by running into it. To stop, use !slimeballstop. Each team's goal is open between 20 and 30 Y, and located at the ends of the field (0 and 99 X for purple and pink respectively). To leave a game, do !slimeballleave, or join a different game. A game of Slimeball ends when no players are left.",

	# Weapons
	"normal": "**Normal weapons** include the **Dual Pistols**, **Revolver**, and the **Yo-yo**. They have a damage modifier of 110%, no cost modifier, 20% crit chance, a crit multiplier of 180%, and a 90% chance to hit. These are straight forward weapons with no gimmicks and average damage.",
	"multiple-hit": "**Multiple hit weapons** include the **SMG**, **Assault Rifle**, and the **Nunchuck**. They deal three attacks per kill command with an overall cost modifier of 80%, and each attack has a 40% damage modifier, 20% crit chance, a crit multiplier of 150%, and an 85% chance to hit. These are very safe reliable weapons, though they deal slightly below average damage on average.",
	"variable-damage": "**Variable damage weapons** include the **Nailbat**, **Bass**, and the **Brass Knuckles**. They have a randomised damage modifier between 50% and 250%, no cost modifier, 10% crit chance, a crit multiplier of 150%, and a 90% chance to hit. On average, these weapons deal pretty good damage for a very reasonable attack cost, but their unreliability can make them quite risky to use.",
	"small-game": "**Small game weapons** include the **Knives** and the **Minecraft Bow**. They have a damage modifier of 50%, a cost modifier of 25%, 10% crit chance, a crit multiplier of 200%, and a 95% chance to hit. These are reliable and underpowered weapons, with extremely low usage costs making them very efficient. Best used for bullying weaklings and hunting.",
	"heavy": "**Heavy weapons** include the **Scythe**, **Shotgun**, and the **Broadsword**. They have a damage modifier of 170%, a cost modifier of 275%, 10% crit chance, a crit multiplier of 150%, and an 80% chance to hit. Unreliable and incredibly expensive to use, to compensate for their very high damage.",
	"defensive": "**Defensive weapons** currently only include the **Umbrella**. While you have one equipped, you take 25% reduced damage! They have a damage modifier of 75%, a cost modifier of 150%, 10% crit chance, a crit multiplier of 150%, and an 85% chance to hit, with a captcha of 4. Best used for punching down or protecting yourself while traveling, these weapons are typically too weak and unwieldy for use in normal combat scenarios.",
	"precision": "**Precision weapons** currently only include the **Katana**. They have a damage modifier of 130%, a cost modifier of 130%, a crit multiplier of 200%, with a captcha of 4. They always hit, and get a guaranteed crit if you have no other weapons equipped. These weapons deal very high and reliably damage, but only if you're willing to bear the burden of their captcha and the lack of flexibility they impose.",
	"incendiary": "**Incendiary weapons** include the **Molotov Bottles** and the **Dragon Claw**. They have a damage modifier of 75%, a cost modifier of 150%, 10% crit chance, a crit multiplier of 200%, a 90% chance to hit, and a captcha of 4. You will take 10% to 15% of your slime as damage if you enter the captcha wrong! They also deal an extra 50% damage to the target and any flagged enemies in the area over time, causing them to explode on death. A more powerful alternative to explosive weapons, if you can deal with the damage being dealt over time, rather than on one go.",
	"explosive": "**Explosive weapons** currently only include the **Grenades**. They have a damage modifier of 75%, a cost modifier of 150%, 10% crit chance, a crit multiplier of 200%, a 90% chance to hit, and a captcha of 4. You will take 10% to 15% of your slime as damage if you enter the captcha wrong! They also deal an extra 50% damage to the target and any flagged enemies in the area. The go-to if you're being swarmed by a mob of weaklings, can clear entire districts in one go.",

	weapon_id_revolver: "**The revolver** is a normal weapon for sale at the Dojo. It's an ordinary six-shot revolver, so you'll have to **!reload** it after attacking six times, though its attack cost is reduced to 80% to compensate. Goes well with a cowboy hat.",
	weapon_id_dualpistols: "**The dual pistols** are a normal weapon for sale at the Dojo. Shockingly, these aren't that common, despite the city being chock-full of gangsters.",
	weapon_id_shotgun: "**The shotgun** is a heavy weapon for sale at the Dojo. It's a double barrelled shotgun, so you'll need to !reload after every two shots, though your cost multiplier is reduced down to 250% to compensate. Grass grows, birds fly, sun shines, and this thing hurts people; it's a force of nature.",
	weapon_id_rifle: "**The rifle** is a multiple-hit weapon for sale at the Dojo. Its magazine only holds enough bullets for ten attacks, so you'll have to **!reload** after hitting the rate limit, but its cost multiplier goes down to 70% to compensate. The experts are still undecided, but most people would agree this is a FAMAS.",
	weapon_id_smg: "**The SMG** is a multiple hit-weapon for sale at the Dojo. Its magazine only holds enough bullets for ten attacks, so you'll have to **!reload** after hitting the rate limit, but its cost multiplier goes down to 70% to compensate. This is pretty good if you like to move around a lot, since the crosshair doesn't grow that much while you're sprinting.",
	weapon_id_bat: "**The nailbat** is a variable-damage weapon for sale at the Dojo. This thing could actually be used to hit balls if you took the nails off it, but that seems a little high-tech...",
	weapon_id_brassknuckles: "**The brass knuckles** are a variable-damage weapon for sale at the Dojo. Made by sanding away most of a huge pair of metal gauntlets.",
	weapon_id_katana: "**The katana** is a precision weapon for sale at the Dojo. This weapon is folded over a thousand times, so it can cut clean through steel and is vastly superior to any other weapon on earth.",
	weapon_id_broadsword: "**The broadsword** is a heavy weapon for sale at the Dojo. Modeled after a legendary Scottish blade, said to have lopped off a hundred enemy heads and then its own wielder's.",
	weapon_id_nunchucks: "**The nunchucks** are a multiple-hit weapon for sale at the Dojo. 我不僅在未經武裝的戰鬥中接受了廣泛的訓練，而且我可以接觸到美國海軍陸戰隊的整個武庫，而且我會盡其所能將你那可悲的屁股從整個非洲大陸上擦掉，你一點都不討厭。 如果只有您能知道您的小“聰明”評論對您造成了什麼邪惡的報應，也許您會held之以鼻。 但是你不能，你沒有，現在你要付出代價了，你這該死的白痴。 我會在你周圍大怒，你會淹死在裡面。 你他媽的死了，孩子。",
	weapon_id_scythe: "**The scythe** is a heavy weapon for sale at the Dojo. Often mistaken for a bardiche, this is actually one of the better weapons for a PvE-focused DEX build if you don't mind the long recovery animation after whiffing an attack.",
	weapon_id_yoyo: "**The yo-yo** is a normal weapon for sale at the Dojo. All the sick tricks you can pull off with this thing are frankly unremarkable compared to the primal joy of cracking a hole through someone's skull with this tungsten wheel of death.",
	weapon_id_bass: "**The bass guitar** is a variable-damage weapon acquired via smelting. It makes the most beautiful sounds when plucking your enemies' tendons.",
	weapon_id_umbrella: "**The umbrella** is a defensive weapon for sale at the Bazaar. It has a futurecore feel to it, with the reinforced graphene canopy allowing visibility from the inside out, but not the other way around. Certainly one of the most stylish weapons seen in the city.",
	weapon_id_knives: "**The throwing knives** are a small-game weapon for sale at the Dojo. These are often quite dull, relying less on the knives's inherent properties and more on the slime-fueled superstrength of its wielders to pierce through their targets.",
	weapon_id_molotov: "**The molotov bottles** are an incendiary weapon for sale at the Dojo. Made with a special slime-based concoction powerful enough to level Juvie's Row if applied correctly. This shit is like bottled malice.",
	weapon_id_grenades: "**The grenades** are an explosive weapon for sale at the Dojo. These may actually be nuclear powered, judging by their ability to wipe out entire districts full of gangsters in one blast.",
	weapon_id_dclaw: "**The Dragon Claw** is an incendiary weapon acquired via smelting. It merges into your body, turning your arm into a weapon of mass destruction.",
	weapon_id_bow: "**The minecraft bow** is a small-game weapon acquired via smelting. The calming music most people hum while wielding this thing is quite the interesting contrast, when considered along with the impaled corpses they leave behind.",

	weapon_id_garrote: "**The Garrote Wire** is a unique weapon. It has a damage modifier of 1500%, no cost modifier, guaranteed hits, and a 1% chance for a crit, which does 1000% damage. When you attack with a garrote, the target has 5 seconds to send any message before the damage is done. If they do, the attack fails.",
	weapon_id_minigun: "The **Minigun** is a special variant of **variable damage weapons**. It deals ten attacks per kill command with an overall cost modifier of 500%, and each attack has a 30% damage modifier, 10% crit chance, a crit multiplier of 200%, and a 50% chance to hit, with a captcha of 6. This is a strange weapon that can potentially deal astronomical damage if used in the right circumstances, and if you're willing to deal with its exceptionally long captcha.",
	weapon_id_staff: "The **Eldritch Staff** is a unique weapon. By default, it has a damage modifier of 30%, a cost modifier of 200%, guaranteed hits, no crit chance, and a crit multiplier of 180%. A number of conditions may be met to increase the damage multiplier by 60% and crit chance by 6.66%: tenebrous weather and locations, grudges between the user and its target, the time of day, and the user's general degeneracy will all contribute to the weapon's effectiveness.",

	weapon_id_spraycan: "**The spray can** is a paint tool for sale at Based Hardware. It has a capping modifier of 0.8 and a spray cost mod of 1. It has a captcha length of 4, a miss chance of 10% and a 10% chance for a crit, which does 2x influence.",
	weapon_id_paintgun: "**The paint gun** is a paint tool for sale at Based Hardware. It has a capping modifier of 0.7 and a spray cost mod of 0.75. It has a captcha length of 6, a miss chance of O% and a 20% chance for a crit, which does 2x influence.",
	weapon_id_paintroller: "**The paint roller** is a paint tool for sale at Based Hardware. It has a capping modifier of 1.75 and a spray cost mod of 4. It has a captcha length of 4, a miss chance of 10% and a 10% chance for a crit, which does 2x influence.",
	weapon_id_paintbrush: "**The paint brush** is a paint tool for sale at Based Hardware. It has a capping modifier of 0.5 and a spray cost mod of .25. It has a captcha length of 4, a miss chance of 10% and a 10% chance for a crit, which does 1.5x influence.",
	weapon_id_watercolors: "**Watercolors** are a paint tool for sale at Based Hardware. It does a set 4000 influence per shot. It has a captcha length of 3, a miss chance of 10% and a .1% chance for a crit, which zeros out the whole district regardless of owner.",
	weapon_id_thinnerbomb: "**Thinner bombs** are a paint tool for sale at Based Hardware. It has a capping modifier of 0.15 and a spray cost mod of 2. It has a captcha length of 4, a miss chance of 10% and a 10% chance for a crit, which does 2x influence. When you cap with a thinner bomb, it is used up, and you have to buy more. When decapping, damage is multiplied by 10.",
        
	weapon_id_hoe: "**The Hoe** is a farming tool for sale at The Ooze Gardens Farms. It can be equipped by both juvies and gangsters to give a 1.5 modifier of slime gain on a !reap command.",
	weapon_id_pitchfork: "**The Pitchfork** is a farming tool for sale at The Ooze Gardens Farms. It can be equipped by both juvies and gangsters to multiply your crops on a !reap command by 2.",
	weapon_id_pickaxe: "**The Pickaxe** is a mining tool acquired via mining. Equipping the pickaxe as a gangster gives you double and a 1.5x chance of unearthing slime poudrins whilst mining.",
	weapon_id_fishingrod: "**The Fishingrod** is a fishing tool acquired via smelting. The fishing rod when equipped doubles your slimegain from a !reel command.",
	# "otp":"If you find that you have a role with 'OTP' in the name, don't be alarmed. This just means that you're outside a safe place, such as your apartment, or your gang base / juvie's row. It's essentially a signal to other players that you're actively participating in the game.",

	#mutation_id_thickerthanblood: "On a fatal blow, immediately receive the opponent’s remaining slime, causing none of it to bleed onto the ground or go your kingpin. Its effects are diminished on hunted enemies, however.",
	mutation_id_fungalfeaster: "On a fatal blow, restore all of your hunger.",
	mutation_id_sharptoother: "The chance to miss with a weapon is reduced by 50%. Specifically, a normal miss will now have a 50% to either go through as a miss or a hit.",
	mutation_id_2ndamendment: "One extra equippable weapon slot in your inventory. You receive a 25% damage buff if two non-tool weapons are in both your weapon slots.",
	mutation_id_bleedingheart: "When you are hit, bleeding pauses for 5 minutes. Use !bleedout to empty your bleed storage onto the floor.",

	mutation_id_whitenationalist: "Cannot be scouted regularly and you scavenge 50% more slime while weather is snowy, which also stacks with the Webbed Feet mutation. Use **'!weather'** to check if it's snowing. You can still be scouted by players with the Keen Smell mutation.",

    mutation_id_handyman:"If you kill an enemy gangster with a tool instead of a weapon, your kingpin gets double the slime they normally do.",
    mutation_id_packrat:"Apartment storage is doubled, regardless of apartment class.",
    mutation_id_stickyfingers:"When using !order at a store, there is a 20% chance to get the item for free. You still need to have the slime to purchase it, though.",

    mutation_id_nervesofsteel:"As a gangster, you aren't damaged by !spray-ing in ally-surrounded districts. As a juvie, you can play Russian Roulette and commit suicide.",

    mutation_id_landlocked:"When standing in a street either bordering an outskirt or the Slime Sea, use !loop to warp to the opposite side of the map. This also works on the ferry and at Slime's End Cliffs. There is a 60 second travel time when using !loop.",
	mutation_id_amnesia:"Your display name is replaced with ????? in EW's messages, and you can delete your message commands without ENDLESS WAR reacting. On a kill, the kill feed message is delayed by 60 seconds."

consult_responses = {
"downtown":"Our complex in Downtown is a sight to behold, one of our most in-demand properties. The whole complex is 2-story penthouses, with built-in storage facility/fallout shelter, restaraunt sized fridge, and state-of-the-art bulletproof windows. This is an offer you won't want to pass up, believe you me. Now, perhaps you're concerned about the large amount of gang violence in the area. But, uh...shut up. ",
"smogsburg":"Have you ever wanted wake up to a haze outside your window every morning? Or to fall asleep to the sound of bazaar merchants bickering with one another in foreign languages? I do, too! That's why I live in Smogsburg, where the prices are low and the furniture is close! Seriously, because of how nearby it is to the bazaar, I've been sniping amazing deals on high quality furniture. Wait...why are you looking at me like that? Actually on second thought, don't buy a property here. I don't want you to steal my shit.",
"krakbay":"Krak Bay is a real social hotspot. Teenagers come from all over to indulge in shopping sprees they can't afford and gorge themselves on fast food with dubious health standards. I say this all as a compliment, of course. Stay here, and you won't have to walk through the city for ages just to get a good taco. As for the apartment quality, you can rest assured that it is definitely an apartment.",
"poudrinalley":"You know, people point to the labrynthine building structure and the morbid levels of graffiti and say this place is a wreck. I don't think so, though. Graffiti is art, and unlike many districts in NLACakaNM, the densely packed cityscape makes it difficult to get shot through your window. The 7-11's right around the corner, to boot. For that, I'd say we're charging a real bargain.",
"greenlightdistrict":"Did you just win the lottery? Have you recently made spending decisions that alientated you from your family? Are you TFAAAP? Then the Green Light District Triple Seven Apartments are for you! Gamble, drink, and do whatever they do in brothels to your heart's content, all far beyond the judging eyes of society! Just remember, with rent this high, you should enjoy those luxuries while they last...",
"oldnewyonkers":"Eh? I guess you must've liked the view outside. I can't blame you. It's a peaceful sight out there. Lots of old folks who just want to live far away from the gang violence and close to people they can understand. They might say some racist shit while you're not looking, but getting called a bustah never hurt anybody. Wait, shit. Don't tell my boss I said the B word. Shit. OK, how about this? We normally charge this property higher, but here's a discount.",
"littlechernobyl":"You're an adventurous one, choosing the good ol' LC. The place is full of ruins and irradiated to hell. A friend of mine once walked into the place, scrawny and pathetic, and walked out a griseled man, full of testosterone and ready to wrestle another crazed mutant. Of course, his hair had fallen out, but never mind that. I'm sure your stay will be just as exciting. Just sign on the dotted line.",
"arsonbrook":"Oh, Arsonbrook? Hang on, I actually need to check if that one's available. You know how it is. We have to make sure we're not selling any torched buildings to our customers. I realize how that sounds, but owning an apartment in Arsonbrook is easier than you think. Once you're settled in with a fire extinguisher or three, the local troublemakers will probably start going for emptier flats. And even if your house does get burned down, it'll be one hell of a story.",
"astatineheights":"If you live with the yuppies in Astatine Heights, people will treat you like a god. When you walk by on the street, they'll say: \"Oh wow! I can't believe such a rich Juvie is able to tolerate my presence! I must fellate him now, such that my breathing is accepted in their presence!\" It has amazing garage space and a walk-in fridge. Trust me, the mere sight of it would make a communist keel over in disgusted envy.",
"gatlingsdale":"You'll be living above a bookstore, it looks like. We'd have a normal apartment complex set up, but these pretentious small businesses refuse to sell their property. Guess you'll have to settle for living in some hipster's wet dream for now. We are working to resolve the inconvenience as soon as we can. On the upside, you have every liberty to shout loudly below them and disrupt their quiet reading enviornment.",
"vandalpark":"Did you know that the apartment complex we have for lease was once lived in by the famous Squickey Henderson? That guy hit like 297 home runs in his career, and you better believe he picked up his bat skills from gang violence. What I'm telling you is, if you buy property here, then you're on your way to the major leagues, probably! Besides, the apartment is actually pretty well built.",
"glocksbury":"There are a lot of police here. I can see the frothing rage in your eyes already, but hear me out. If you want to go do the gang violence, or whatever you kids do these days, then you can go over someplace else and do it there. Then, when you come back, your poudrins and dire apples will still be unstolen. I suppose that still means you're living around cops all the time, but for this price, that may be an atrocity you have to endure.",
"northsleezeborough":"This place may as well be called Land of the Doomers, for as lively as the citizens are. They're disenfranchised, depressed, and probably voted for Gary Johnson. My suggestion is not to avoid them like the plague. Instead, I think you really ought to liven up their lives a little. Seriously, here you have a group of un-harassed people just waiting for their lives to go from bad to worse! I think a juvenile delinquent like yourself would be right at home. Wait, is that incitement? Forget what I just said.",
"southsleezeborough":"Ah, I see. Yes, I was a weeb once, too. I always wanted to go to the place where anime is real and everyone can buy swords. Even if the streets smell like fish, the atmosphere is unforgettable. And with this apartment, the place actually reflects that culture. The doors are all sliding, the bathroom is Japanese-style, and your window overlooks to a picturesque view of the Dojo.",
"oozegardens":"This place has such a lovely counterculture. Everybody makes the community beautiful with their vibrant gardens, and during the night they celebrate their unity with PCP and drum circles. Everybody fucks everybody, and they all have Digibro-level unkempt beards. If you're willing to put gang violence aside and smell the flowers, you'll quickly find your neighbors will become your family. Of course, we all know you're unwilling to do that, so do your best to avoid killing the damn dirty hippies, OK?",
"cratersville":"OK...what to say about Cratersville? It's cheap, for one. You're not going to get a better deal on housing anywhere else. It's... It has a fridge, and a closet, and everything! I'm pretty sure there aren't holes in any of those objects, either, at least not when you get them. What else? I guess it has less gang violence than Downtown, and cleaner air than Smogsburg. Actually, fuck it. This place sucks. Just buy the property already. ",
"wreckington":"So you want to eat a lot of really good pancakes. And you also want to live in a place that looks like war-torn Syria. But unfortunately, you can't do both at the same time. Well boy howdy, do I have a solution for you! Wreckington is world famous for its abandoned and demolished properties and its amazing homestyle diner. More than one apartment complex has actually been demolished with people still in it! How's that for a life-enhancing risk?",
"slimesend":"I like to imagine retiring in Slime's End. To wake up to the sound of gulls and seafoam, to walk out into the sun and lie under a tree for the rest my days, doesn't it sound perfect? Then, when my old age finally creeps up on me, I can just walk off the cliff and skip all those tearful goodbyes at the very end. Er...right, the apartment. It's pretty good,  a nice view. I know you're not quite retiring age, but I'm sure you'll get there.",
"vagrantscorner":"Hmm. I've never actually been to Vagrant's Corner. And all it says on this description is that it has a lot of pirates. Pirates are pretty cool, though. Like, remember that time when Luffy had Rob Lucci in the tower, and he Gum Gum Gatling-ed the living shit out of him and broke the building? That was sick, dude. OK, Google is telling me that there's a pretty good bar there, so I suppose that would be a perk, too.",
"assaultflatsbeach":"Sure, the flat has massive storage space in all aspects. Sure, you can ride a blimp to work if you feel like it. Sure, it's the very definition of \"beachhouse on the waterfront\". But do you REALLY know why this is a top piece of real estate? Dinosaurs. They're huge, they attack people, they're just an all around riot. If you catch some of the ones here and sell them to paleontologists, this place will pay itself back in no time.",
"newnewyonkers":"Let's be real for a second: I don't need to tell you why New New Yonkers is amazing. They have basically everything there: bowling, lazer tag, arcades, if it distracts adolescents, they have it. Don't let the disgusting old people tell you otherwise: this place is only going up from here. Sure, we had to skimp out a bit on the structural integrity of the place, but surely that won't be noticed until vandals eventually start trying to break it down.",
"brawlden":"Brawlden's not too scary to live in, relatively speaking. Maybe you'll get pummeled by a straggling dad if you look at him funny, but chances are he won't kill you. If the lanky fellows down at N.L.A.C.U. Labs are able to live in Brawlden, I'm sure you can too. And think of the money you're saving! A \"quality\" apartment, complete with the best mini-fridge and cupboard this side of the city!",
"toxington":"Are you really considering living in a place that's completely overrun with deadly gases? It's called TOXINGTON, you idiot! The few people who live there now are miners whose brains were already poisoned into obsolescence. I know we technically sell it as a property, but come on, man! You have so much to live for! Call a suicide hotline or get a therapist or something. Anything but this.",
"charcoalpark":"It's a po-dunk place with po-dunk people. That is to say, it doesn't matter. Charcoal Park is the equivalent of a flyover state, but its location on the edge of the map prevents even that utility. That's exactly why it's perfect for a juvie like yourself. If you want to go into hiding, I personally guarantee the cops will never find you. Of course, you may end up assimilating with the uninspired fucks that live there, but I think that it still fills a niche here in our fair city.",
"poloniumhill":"If you live with the wannabes in Polonium Hill, people will treat you like a dog. When you walk by on the street, they'll say: \"Oh damn! I can't believe such a desperate Juvie is able to go on living! I must slit their throat just to put 'em out of their misery!\" It nonetheless has amazing storage space and a big, gaudy-looking fridge. Trust me, the mere sight of it would make a communist keel over from the abject waste of material goods. I'm just being honest, buddy. Go live in Astatine Heights instead.",
"westglocksbury":"If you ever wanted to turn killing people into a reality show, this is probably where you'd film it. The cops were stationed in Glocksbury in order to deal with this place, but they don't tread here for the same reason most of us don't. The corpses here get mangled. I've seen ripped out spines, chainsaw wounds, and other Mortal Kombat-like lacerations. Our photographer couldn't even take a picture of the property without getting a severed leg in the shot. But, as a delinquent yourself, I imagine that could also be a good thing.",
"jaywalkerplain":"Are you one of those NMU students? Or maybe you're after the drug culture. Well in either case, Jaywalker Plain's an excellent place to ruin your life. In addition to having lots of like-minded enablers, the countless parks will give you the perfect spot to pace and ruminate on your decisions. You know, this is a sales pitch. I probably shouldn't make the place sound so shitty.",
"crookline":"Now, we've gotten a lot of complaints about thieves here, stealing our clients' SlimeCoin wallets and relieving them of our rent money. We acknowledge this is a problem, so for every purchase of a property in Crookline, we've included this anti-thievery metal codpiece. Similar to how a chastity belt blocks sexual urges, this covers your pockets, making you invulnerable to petty thieves. Apart from that perk, in Crookline you'll get a lovely high-rise flat with all the essentials, all coated in a neat gloomy neon aesthetic.",
"dreadford":"Have you ever wanted to suck on the sweet, sweet teat of ultra-decadence? Do you have multiple yachts? Do you buy both versions of Pokemon when they come out, just because you can blow the cash? Ha. Let me introduce you to the next level of opulence. Each apartment is a full-scale mansion, maintained by some of the finest slimebutlers in the industry. In the morning they tickle your feet to get you up, and at night they sing you Sixten ballads to drift you back to restful slumber. The place is bulletproof, fireproof, and doubles as a nuclear bunker if things go south. And it stores...everything. The price, you say? Shit, I was hoping you wouldn't ask.",
"maimridge":"Perhaps you think it's sketchy that we're selling lightly refurbished log cabins built eons ago. Well let me ask you something, young juvie: do you like getting laid? Well, living in Maimridge is your ticket into ice-cold lust and debauchery. You just bring a lady friend or whoever into your isolated mountain cabin, and our state-of-the-art faulty electrical wiring will leave you stranded and huddling for warmth in no time flat! Wow...I'm picturing you now. Yeah, you definitely want this one."

I may not be able to ride all the rollercoasters I want, but I\'m light enough for Big Bro to carry me on his back and give me a good view of the battlefield."For lack of a better word, he\'s the \'brainz\' of the Gigashambler/Microshambler tag team.\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/743240814250950678/743259271298416640/microshambler_gravestone.png',
